No suction. Bought this as an \"inexpensive\" replacement to Dyson that died after 5 years. You get what you pay for evidently.

The item arrived in reasonable time, and assembling is fairly straight forward. However, it doesn't look very new out of the box. Some parts are at the wrong spots and some have dust on them. I don't want to believe Amazon, being such a big name, is selling refurbished items, so I am thinking this may have been caused from shipping. Once put together, the blue cover that covers the waste bag couldn't be closed properly, It falls on the floor all the time while vaccuming. I ended up taping it to the main body. The noise of this thing produces is so high it is unbelievable. I couldn't hear my husband talking when he stands 2 feet away. And this vacuum does NOT work on bare floors (tile floor, wood floor, etc.). It just doesn't work. It not only blows the floor dust around, it also spit out what it already vacuumed in. On a scale of 0-10, 0 being 'not working at all' I rate a -3 for it on the bare floors because it makes it worse. However, good news is it does work on carpet. I rate an 8 for it on carpets. And this is the only reason why I didn't return it.<br />Overall I don't recommend this product, but if you can stand the noise and you only use it on carpets, it works.",

So, for less than 1/2 the price and better ratings, I got this one.  Since I switched from a Dirt Devil that I never did like and it had a bag, I can't say this picked up more for sure, but according to the size of the bag the DD used and what came out of this canister, I'd say it probably would have filled the bag a good 1/3- 1/2 the way.  No kidding.  We had just borrowed a friend's Kirby to vacuum a few days ago, so it's not like a month's worth of gunk was laying on the floor.  Only did a 20x15 (guess) living room.  I'd say I'm excited and overwhelmed with the performance but I hate vacuuming, so . . .  Anyway, I think I'm going to like this (as much as one can &#34;like&#34; a vacuum) and at least now know I have cleaner floors.  OH, I was vacuuming in my bare feet -- I don't know if it was in my head or not, the carpet felt softer, fluffier where I vacuumed.  I'll see what my family thinks.

What a waste of $200 that vacuum cleaner was.<br /><br />So far first impression these are my pros and cons<br /><br />Pros: lots of power, easy to assemble, loving the option to pop the unit off the roller to clean. Fairly quiet considering who much power this thing has.<br /><br />Cons: This thing is HEAVY! Itâ€™s a lot heavier than what Iâ€™m used to, but Iâ€™m assuming the extra weight is needed for the extra power. I wish the nozzle was a little bit longer to clean blinds and windows. Also the tools themselves could use an upgrade. Decent but not great. Doable tho. People complaining thereâ€™s broke, i could see how. This thing is made of plastic.

It took a while to figure out if the amount of water coming out was appropriate. I learned that you have to sweep very slowly to make sure the brushes are actually cleaning the floor when moving forward and that the water is being suctioned properly while moving towards you.<br /><br />I gave this 3 stars because it is so slow and the water marks from the brushes didn't seem to be cleaning the floor evenly. The water reservoir is small but it lasts long enough to Clean a good size surface.<br /><br />The noise is about as loud as my Dyson vacuum but not as heavy.<br /><br />Overall it gets the job done and did clean what I thought was a already half clean floor.<br /><br />I decided to keep it and although I'm not sure if it will replace my weekly brooming and mopping, it was nice to just use the Floor mate without sweeping first, although I don't think it's recommended but I wanted to see how it did.

After a couple passes, I had filled up the canister. This is not saying the canister is small - it's larger than my Shark's. This is just showing how much more dust is picked up!

The first unit I bought replaced a very nice Dyson, which I used for 15 years until the motor gave out.  The second one (this one) was bought to replace a 4 year old Kirby Avelir 2.  The reason I replaced the Kirby was simply because it is way too heavy and takes way too much work to change over to accessory mode.  This model Shark does everything it says it does and then some.  The lift away feature is beyond cool, the suction is awesome and it has been designed to be extremely user friendly.  The only reason I could not give it five stars is because this thing truly has a mind of its own during normal vacuuming operation.  What I mean is, the unit is so powerful that it will take you for a jog if you are not careful, especially moving forward.  There is a bit of effort required to control it as it wants to run when you only want to walk.  I was surprised by this as the other Shark does no such thing and is much easier to control.  Maybe it is due to the second roller or maybe its just how this unit is meant to work.  I would highly recommend it since it does an amazing job but just be aware that it can get away from you if you are not expecting this kind of forward momentum.  It is also a bit harder to pull backward since it simply wants to go forward.  I might try the NV356E S2 model instead, which is both $119 less expensive and is much easier to control.  I probably should have just bought two of those instead of going for the higher end model but one thing is for certain, I will only buy Shark vacuums from now on.  They do not disappoint.",

The cord is just a couple feet too short so I have to keep moving where I have it plugged in and we only have carpet in the living room, hall and stairs leading to the basement.  Because the brush moves when using the attachments we broke a belt 1 1/2 weeks after its arrival when my son was vacuuming the upholstery and did not think to adjust the height of the vacuum to accommodate the carpet.  The upholstery attachment works great but does snag the fabric on my upholstered chairs for the dining room table but is fine on the other furniture so far.

		"text": "An update to my previous review. I'm knocking this from a three-star to a paltry one for two reasons:<br />1. As previously noted, the vacuum is very prone to tipping over when using any of the hose attachments. Not only is this a nuisance, but it's also caused damage to walls, furniture, and my leg when it's unceremoniously fallen over. I have to brace it against something stable in order to keep it from tipping and causing damage to itself or other things. That is a huge design flaw, and absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />2.  I've come to find that the suction sucks. I've followed directions to the letter and I make sure to clean filters regularly (the instructions say failure to do so causes loss of suction).  On bare floors I find that some things get picked up easily --mainly dog hair-- while others will absolutely not get removed unless the carpet brush is engaged. I'm not talking things that are stuck down; if I blow on the debris, my breath will move it; however, the vacuum alone without the assistance of the brush will not. I'm not sure if it's the terrible suction or if it's the carpet brush shooting stuff all over the place (which I have to keep on unless 80% of the time stuff will not get picked up), but invariably once I've vacuumed an area, 30 seconds later I'll turn around and there's stuff there again!  I spend a ridiculous amount of time and effort to vacuum because I have to keep back-tracking and vacuuming areas that I've already done.  Extremely frustrating and again, unacceptable.<br /><br />A bonus negative:  I'll be vacuuming and notice that it's pulling up even less than usual, and then realize that somehow the plastic piece the hose attaches to has come loose from the unit, so essentially it's picking up debris and shooting it right back out again. I haven't even touched that part of the vacuum, so I have absolutely no idea how that happens!  I can only think it's the vibration of the motor that causes it to come loose... unless I have a poltergeist that just enjoys messing with my vacuum.<br /><br />The initial review is as follows:<br />I got this to replace a Sears Kenmore upright vacuum that, at the time (easily over 10 years ago) was quite expensive (over $500) but was also very highly rated.  I mention this only because, compared to this Shark model, it was quite a beast: heavy, bulky, cumbersome, etc.  I realize most consumers don't want those negative adjectives to apply to a vacuum, so in the years since, companies have made quite the drastic changes in the design, build, and materials of current models.  Is that a good thing?  Yes, and no.<br /><br />The Shark Navigator Pro looks attractive, but has a particularly feminine, &#34;dainty&#34; feel to it (even though I'm a guy, I don't mean that observation as necessarily a negative thing, it's just quite different from my old one).  The setup was relatively easy, but having so many pieces that the consumer fits together him/herself concerns me; mainly because each becomes an area that could easily break or fail, versus the older styles that came pre-built by a factory with bolts and screws rather than plastic parts that snap in place. Again, I'm not going to count that as a negative because I've only had it for a couple of months and as of yet there's been no issues.  It's just a concern.<br /><br />The suction is quite powerful.  It seems to pull up a good amount of dust, dirt, debris, and dog hair.  I definitely like that the head self-adjusts to wood flooring and carpet without having to bend over and move a lever to manually shift it up and down.  It goes from floor, to short-pile throw rugs to an area rug I have with quite a deep pile and never seems to have an issue. The only down-side is that it doesn't easily pick up any debris that might be on the floor right up against an area rug.  If I go from floor to rug, it seems to work fine, but if I go from a rug to floor (and the head shifts down to accommodate the height change), it misses about 1/4 inch right up against the side of the rug and I have to turn around and go at it from the opposite direction.  I noticed a negative review here that mentioned the brush was very weak, but I can only assume that was a flaw in their particular machine because the brush on my seems to work very well.  It's fluffed up matted-down carpet fibers far better than my Kenmore did and it leaves very distinct &#34;vacuum lines&#34; in the pile -- for some, that might be a negative, but I've always liked the lines.  When guests come over and see them, they immediately know you just vacuumed for their arrival, and thus you're a wonderful person and host. ;-)<br /><br />When I first pulled it out of the box, I was shocked at how narrow the vacuum head is... it literally looks like a child's toy since my old vacuum head was at least 50% wider.  The negative to this is that I have to do more pushing and pulling to get the same surface area clean, but the positive is that I can maneuver it into smaller areas, plus the head is shorter height-wise and longer in depth, so I can also get it further under furniture than I could before.  It also seems to pick up stuff far closer to walls and in corners, which is a huge plus.<br /><br />Now there are some definite design flaws that have bugged me since getting it.  First, I absolutely hate the placement of the hooks to wind the cord around in back.  The suction hose goes up one side of the back and then over to an attachment along the other side... plus another longer-reach attachment next to it.  Basically then the hooks are inset and you have to maneuver the cord between the hose/attachments and around the hooks... also watching out for a brush attachment that's planted right in the middle.  If they'd moved the hooks out further (or better yet, put them on the side that doesn't have the reach attachments), it would be FAR easier to wrap the cord.<br /><br />The other thing is that there's a completely useless &#34;anti-tip&#34; hook that the hose goes around towards the bottom before it loops up to the top again.  I have no idea in what idyllic parallel universe this feature actually works, but mine has tipped numerous times while using attachments.  With my old one, I could pull on the hose and the vacuum would roll along behind me (if there was enough cord length, of course), With this one, even a gentle tug sends the top-heavy unit toppling backwards... and since it's all dainty and plastic, I'm afraid if that happens too often it'll be broken in pieces soon.  Even worse, to get the full length of the hose, you have to take it OUT of the &#34;anti-tip&#34; hook, so you're pulling the hose even more AND disabling the one feature supposedly designed to keep the vacuum from falling over!<br /><br />There's a &#34;suction release&#34; switch on the hose right where it fits into the attachments which I think is terrible placement.  As I'm using the attachments, I have to consciously make sure I don't push the switch accidentally with my hand (especially when vacuuming furniture since I'm using a back-and-forth motion) because -- as the name would suggest -- it decreases suction by allowing air into the hose.  It's also easily accidentally pushed forward when putting the hose back in place to use the vacuum and suddenly it's not picking up as much as it was before.<br /><br />So my consensus is that so far it's been good despite some annoying design flaws. If it had been any more expensive, I probably would have returned it to get something more sturdy for my dollars; but for the price point, I think it adequately does what it's supposed to.",

Those two vacuums were good for the price, but had their strengths and weaknesses compared to this Dirt Devil. The Hoover had the most suction power, then the Dirt Devil second, and the Bissell last. The Hoover took a bag, which I am not too fond of these days. The Bissell was bagless, but it was messy trying to remove a full cup of debris, due to the design. The design of the Dirt Devil creates little mess when removing the debris cup, since it is easier to detach it and the bottom has a design where the cup remains closed until you bring it to the garbage can. I've only had the Dirt Devil vacuum for a few months and cannot comment on the reliability. The Bissell lasted 4 years with a couple of belt and filter changes. The Hoover still works after 3 years with a filter change and a few bag changes. I still use the Hoover upstairs and leave the Dirt Devil downstairs. If the Dirt Devil breaks before within a 3 year time frame, then I will update this review to reflect that. All-around it is good for the price.",

This is the end of the pros.<br /><br />The unit feels like it is going to break at a momentâ€™s notice, you might say well maybe it is very light weight and that is what you are feeling.  However that is not the case.  First where the unitâ€™s canister connects to the suction\\brush section it allows you to have greater control in its mobility however when you lock the unit the upright portion it is still very loose and feels like it is going to give out at any moment and crash down.<br /><br />Second, when using the unit within twenty seconds a high pitch squeal came from the unit indicating an air leak in the chain.  After attempting a number of adjustments to the suction strength reattaching the hoses, making sure everything is flush, the sound continues.  The bottom hose attaches to the canister with a very cheap rubber gasket and I can see small gaps.<br /><br />Third, when attempting to use the wand\\accessories, the unit shows a lack of engineering, you need to detach the hose from the floor brush and use the hose extender to bring suction to the wand.  The wand provides zero extension and the hose extension is short meaning if you are trying to work in stairs or other areas you may find yourself in an awkward position that prevents you from being able to actually clean, i.e. the point of the device.<br /><br />Fourth, when using the brush accessory, you have to hold it over the surface otherwise the brush will stop spinning.  I should not have to find a magically stance to ensure the brush is going to work which will only be hampered due to the lack of extension from the hose\\wand.<br /><br />In the end it was a very inexpensive vacuum and I had hopes that the build quality would not suffer because of that but it clearly does.

My only problem with this vacuum is the quality of the materials used for the handle. The rubber part stated to peel off after literally week and a half of daily use. Then a few months later, the plastic on the base of the handle cracked (see attached pictures). I lift the vacuum often to clean my couches and I don't think the handle is design to withstand the weight of the vacuum, which is in the heavy side despite it being described as lightweight.",

My main problem with it is that it has two wheels with deep treads that get dust, dirt, cat litter, etc. stuck in them which it then proceeds to trail everywhere as you are vacuuming. Otherwise I do like this vacuum a lot.",

Iâ€™m not going to change my star rating yet because weâ€™ve only had it a week. Will update after a month of use.<br />Man, where do I start? This is the worst vacuum! I work at a gym and they purchased this. From day one of putting this monstrosity together, it has and still has terrible suction power. Hose barely stretches, the cord isnâ€™t very long. The belt smells like itâ€™s constantly burning. Donâ€™t waste your money!",

When it starts to lag in suction, it's time to clean the washable filter. After it's clean it has great suction again. I've had a few expensive vacuums with suction problems,I've cleaned them and yet they still had a hard time picking up much. Kirby, Oreck, Bissell...others too. I will be buying an extra filter to be able to clean any day(takes 24 hours to dry completely).",

Likely the rust falls inside the motor and shorts it out. But that's ok...it also has non-replaceable fuses hardwired into the circuit. So instead of a $3 fuse, I need a new $200 vacuum.

		"text": "I seem to go through a bunch of vacuum cleaners.  The last two I purchased were Bissel and they each lasted only about a year.  When my last one broke a few months ago I decided to research and try to find the best vacuum under $100 I could find.<br /><br />Although there were newer models of Hoover vacuum's, this particular model won best choice by Consumer Reports and had great reviews on Amazon as well so I decided to give it a shot.  I also looked at a lot of other web-sites and this particular model was consistently ranked in the top ten, and on a lot of sites it was ranked in the top 2 or 3.<br /><br />I bought an Amazon Warehouse deal that said it was brand new but had a damaged box and got it for only $57!<br /><br />Unfortunately, after using it for only about a month and a half it has already developed a problem.  I just can't win.<br /><br />It works well overall but there is a very loud and high pitched whistle that is extremely annoying.  I found the problem but don't know how to fix it.  The whistle is caused by a not very tight connection at the top of the removable &#34;bucket&#34; that catches all the dirt.  If you hold it tight or adjust it just right the whistle goes away but it seems like the gasket isn't tight enough and just doesn't make good contact.<br /><br />It's too late to send it back so I really don't know what else to do.  I can't just tape it up to fix it because it's on a removable part, so any suggestions could be very helpful and would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />I love the fact this vacuum has an automatic rewinding cord but I honestly don't think the foot pedal will last very long.  I don't think they could've made it any cheaper or out of any thinner plastic if they tried.  I can see this getting broken very easily.  When it does, I don't know what I'm going to do with the cord because there is nowhere on the vacuum to store it like there is on all other vacuum's I've owned since you're supposed to be able to retract it back into the vacuum itself.  I'll update this review if/when this piece breaks.<br /><br />Otherwise the vacuum seems to be very well made and it does its main job very well.  It's very powerful and is easy to operate.  The power button is on the handle and I would prefer it if it were instead a foot switch, but at least it's less likely to break since it's a switch on the handle.<br /><br />I don't know why they couldn't have made the cord retracting pedal out of the same material they made the vacuum pedal that allows the vacuum to lock upright or (for lack of a better word) &#34;recline&#34; for use.  That pedal seems to be well made and I think it will last as long as the vacuum.<br /><br />I was really hoping I had found one that would last me for at least 2-3 years, but I'm not so sure due to the whistle and the annoying noise it makes plus I'm sure there is a loss of suction with that, too.<br /><br />I do like how easy it is to remove, empty, and replace the dirt container, but just wish it made a better seal when replacing it.  It doesn't get clogged up and is easy to remove all the pet hair and dirt unlike my last Bissel which would get clogged by all the pet hair and carpet fuzz and would take forever to clean out.<br /><br />It's also the quietest vacuum I've ever owned, by far.  I'm surprised at this considering how powerful it is.<br /><br />It's not at all heavy and is easy to maneuver.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to get all the way to the corners or edges though, but has a hose attachment that is useful for that.<br /><br />This probably goes without saying, but I also love that there are no bags to replace.  I'll never buy a vacuum that requires bags ever again.  The problems I've had with my last several vacuums have been the motor, things getting clogged, and now a whistle which may lead to not enough suction, but I've never had a problem with the canister and can't imagine why anyone would ever buy a &#34;bag&#34; vacuum ever again.<br /><br />I'll update this review with any new news or when this one breaks.  Crossed fingers that this one will last me a while, though.",
