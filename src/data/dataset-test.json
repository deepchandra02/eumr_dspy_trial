Also, the vacuum is very powerful and shredded some wires that were too close to me while cleaning - something that has never been a problem before.

Also the \"dirt container\" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.

One plastic tab snapped off the hose bracket when I pressed it in place.  I decided not to bother taking it back.<br /><br />As a cleaner, it is literally amazing.  I watched my carpets  go from grimy gray to blue, and dog hair and dust particles removed from various nooks and crannies with the tools.<br /><br />BUT... once the canister is full it is literally a nightmare to clean.  Pulling it out results in a shower of grime.  And emptying it out required me to literally bend up a metal coat hanger and spend a good 15 minutes pulling and digging matted hair out of the innards, where it gets trapped between various internal projections.  Shaking, pounding and trying to pull different parts apart did nothing.  Now maybe this won't be a problem if pet hair is not a major ingredient on your floor but I see other complaints here about the canister design.  And the problem is far worse if you overfill the canister, so you have to track the level like a hawk.  Who needs that?<br /><br />I'd give this unit 5 stars other than the canister problem.  Eureka needs to redesign the canister and make a built-in plunger you can simply depress to push the dirt out -- voila!  I'd pay an extra 20 bucks for that, easily.  As it is, I'm debating going back and trying to get a refund.",

I like that it's a HEPA-filtered vacuum too, which is nice because I can still breathe after vacuuming (unlike my cheapo old vacuum which caused me to need my inhaler).  I live in a carpeted apartment with two VERY FURRY kitty cats.  If I let a week pass before vacuuming, I have to empty the canister twice in my 1,200 sq foot apartment!  The vacuum really does work as advertised... it does not loose its suction and really picks up the dust and cat hair.<br />I bought the Animal (aka purple), because it was on sale.  The difference between the three versions (yellow, red, and purple) is the attachments they come with.  The yellow comes with none, the red comes with the floor attachment, and the purple comes with the floor and &quot;animal&quot; attachment.  I strongly recommend that you just purchase the yellow model, since I haven't found much need for the attachments.  I haven't used the floor attachment yet, but the animal one is a bit of a pain (but I could be using it wrong).  The attachment kinda swivels when I'm trying to use it on my furniture to remove the cat hair.  I find that rubbing a damp kitchen glove works better than the animal attachment at removing cat hair.<br />The hose really extends far, but I find that the vacuum still moves around when I use the hose.  Maybe my hose isn't as worn in yet, or maybe there are brakes on the vacuum I haven't found.<br />One other negative about this vacuum is the canister.  There's a nifty trigger to remove the canister, and another nifty trigger to drop the bottom of the canister for emptying dust.  However, sometimes the bottom of the canister doesn't close all the way so I have to hold onto it until I get can get it over a trash can or over the vacuum.  Maybe there's dust in the cracks to cause the problem, but that's just a minor annoyance.<br />That said, I really do love this vacuum.

Of course it's going to topple over with the slightest tug on the short hose.<br /><br />The other annoying design element is the handle -- which doubles as an extension hose. It's not long enough to reach the floor while you're standing, and it's awkward/difficult to use the extension with one hard -- that's required unless you want to drag the vacuum cleaner around your house on its side.<br /><br />If you're using this vacuum cleaner exclusively for carpeted floors and aren't going to use the hose/attachments, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal.

In fact, it wound up being a two person job. Someone stronger had to move it around, while someone shorter had the use the \"xl\" wand to get beneath the furniture. If it's supposed to be XL, they should supply a much longer wand so that the user doesn't have to bend so far to get beneath the furniture. It was an exhausting and back breaking job. The suction seemed sufficient so if all you need is a vacuum for a few area rugs, it's ok, but not for wall to wall carpeting in several rooms. It's just too much work. Unfortunately, this will have to be returned. If someone out there has found a good suction,self propelling, automatic cord rewind, easy to empty, vacuum, I'd like to know which one it is.",

		"text": "I bought this vacuum a little over two years ago directly from Dyson and have been meaning to write a review ever since. Better late than never!<br /><br />For reference, I have concrete floors, wooden floors, and lots of rugs. I use my vacuum for all of the above to pick up dirt and pet hair. I have two cats and two large dogs (a Great Dane and a large mutt) weighing in at a total of 260lbs.<br /><br />Pros:<br />This is fantastic for normal vacuuming on flat surfaces. I\u2019m always amazed at the amount of dirt and animal hair it picks up.<br /><br />I really like that this is bag less although I have to empty it several times when using.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The ball and wheels are large so it is hard to get under furniture like coaches and beds.<br /><br />It is a BIG pain to use the wand. And I use the wand A LOT. You are constantly fighting with it and end up pulling the whole vacuum, having the vacuum tip over, and/or having the hose kink up.  The wand hose always wants to retract back into the vacuum and really pulls the whole vacuum around with you. You have to try to put the vacuum against something so it won\u2019t tip over and have the hose at the right angle so you get proper suction. Using this would be especially challenging for anyone older because it takes some strength to pull the wand and use it.<br /><br />I use my Dyson to vacuum furniture like coaches and dog beds. I think any pet owners do this as well. Previously, I\u2019ve had canister vacuums that worked well, I bought this prior to Dyson having these.  Now, I use the wand plus the Tangle-free Turbine tool. It isn\u2019t very effective. The tool is really small so you can\u2019t cover a lot of surface area plus you are always fighting with the wand wanting to retract back into the vacuum. The suction isn\u2019t very great either.<br /><br />In the canister itself, pet hair and dust gets stuck up inside the top of the canister on either side of the top filter. Not a huge deal but it is a pain and nasty to try to get out.<br /><br />Overall, if I ever get another Dyson, I will try out a canister model because I think it would fit my needs better. But I would also investigate other brands that may be better for getting hard to reach surfaces as well as upholstery.  For the price and the hype of Dysons, I\u2019m disappointed in this vacuum.  I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.",

I spent the same amount of time and went the same amount of distance with each. I then emptied each bin onto separate paper towels to see which vac picked up the most. Not horribly scientific but it worked. The most shocking thing was how dirty our carpet was. The second most shocking thing was that there was big difference in the piles from each vac. I really, really wanted the Dyson to win. Like I said the Shark is so damn ugly it deserves to lose. Not only does the Dyson look cooler but I was believing the hype about how much engineering went into their vacs. Lots of expensive engineering should win, right? But unfortunately the Shark picked up at least twice as much fuzz and dirt as the Dyson. This is our first bagless vac so just seeing proof that you're pulling stuff out of the carpet that you would ordinarily wouldn't see is kind of satisfying in itself (even though I don't know how anyone can call bagless vacs more hygienic since there's probably a dust storm when you drop your load in the trash)<br /><br />Our old vac is a Hoover Windtunnel bought thanks to CR's advice. The cord was short and it's very loud. I think it may have vacuumed well but since it's bagged you don't really get the same satisfying feedback and assume it's not picking up much. Plus it was starting to stink. The Hoover would also shoot nuggets all over the place when vacuuming the wood floors since you couldn't turn off the brushroll/bar. This is another thing I tested with both the Dyson and Shark, whether or not they picked up large objects on flat floors. The Shark won again. The Dyson (due its much touted self-adjusting cleaner head) just pushed the bigger stuff around, the Shark got everything. The Shark has a fixed cleaner head height too. The Shark seemed like it did best on the deep pile of our area rug than the relatively short carpet we have but it also passed our hardwood floor test.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Easy to assemble<br />-It's relatively quiet, not whisper-quiet but much better than our Hoover<br />-Brushroll is easy to clean, the hair tends to collect in the center - big points for that<br />-You can turn off the brushroll<br />-There's window for the brushroll<br />-There are 2 light to indicate if the brushroll is on or off, one on the button, one by the brushroll<br />-Picks up big chunks on hardwood floors and doesn't spit them everywhere<br />-Filters are easily visible, right in your face when you go to empty the bin, so you know when they need to be cleaned<br />-Reclines and sits up easily, the Dyson is a b*tch when it comes to this<br />-There's a crude but effective suction adjustment just below the handle<br />-There's a \"cord hook\" on the neck so if you don't want the cord dangling down by the attachment<br />-Easy to empty<br />-Cord is long enough, even though the Dyson's was longer by a few feet<br />-The vacuum is easy enough to maneuver and gets under most of the furniture we have<br />-You can convert it into 3 different vacuums pretty easily<br />-When you sit the vac upright the brushroll automagically turns off, making things quieter<br />-The cleaner head is narrow. This seems both good and bad, good because it concentrates the suction area but bad in that it would take longer to vacuum. The Dyson's is 12\", the Shark's 9.5\"<br />-Exhausts the (hot) air out the front, the Dyson sends blazing hot air at your legs. I thought the Shark's air was cool or nonexistant until I stuck my hand in front of the HEPA filter where it is on the warm side<br />-I don't know what the Complete-Seal is they talk about but the vacuum does have 4 filters (more or less): a dust screen, a foam filter, a felt filter that looks like a thin scrub brush and a HEPA filter that looks like a HEPA filter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It's ugly<br />-It looks cheap<br />-The cord release seems loose, there's a screw you can turn but it doesn't seem to help<br />-The lights are poor, they're too focused and bright, not diffused enough<br />-Not super light-weight, though this may actually be a Pro since more weight on the front probably helps the vac suck better<br />-Tools are attached by friction. Dyson's for the most part use a locking system<br />-The Power Brush seems like a weak link. When you use full suction it almost sounds too powerful. When I looked inside it looked a little sketchy, the brushroll in the Power Brush is vacuum/belt driven and difficult to clean hair out of. It seemed to clean pretty well but the belt is tiny and looks fragile and after one set of stairs there was already gunk built up in the vacuum wheel that drives the belt.<br /><br />If Shark wanted to have a red shiny metal coating on their vacuum they could have at least went with an anodized finish. It probably would make the vacuum cost $15 more and it would get scratched every time you used it but at least it would look better and solve all my gripes about this thing. So far they get plenty of points for engineering and design but almost as many negative points for material selection. There might be other bagless vacs out there that pull more than the Shark but at least I can return the Dyson now and hope the Shark lasts at least to the end of its warranty.<br /><br />UPDATE 07/31/2013:<br /><br />The foam filter has started to rip in 2 places. I believe this is the 2nd filter after the dustbin, so right before the HEPA. It's good that the foam filter has been catching a lot of dust and dirt instead that stuff heading straight for the HEPA. Ideally the dust/dirt would have stayed in the dustbin as designed. The manual recommends to tap-clean the filter between washes which should happen every 3 months. Our carpets were very dirty when we bought the vac so we probably put 4-6 weeks worth of vacuuming into 2 weeks, because of this we hand washed the filters with plain cold water 2 times in between vacuuming. The filter seems to get filled up by the finer, heavier dirt. We've been pretty conservative about emptying the dustbin so it's definitely not an overflow problem. I contacted customer service and they said it's $12.95 +S&H/Tax, so probably $20 for a new filter. It's not covered by the warranty since it's considered normal wear and tear. If the hand washing we did was the cause of the two 1\" rips then I guess you can expect the filters to tear after 9 months. So far I haven't found them on Amazon or anywhere else online.<br /><br />Otherwise we like the vacuum. Surprisingly CR's ratings are right on. Except for maybe the pethair since we don't have pets. One of our family members has long hair and as typical it does get wrapped around the brushroll. It's fairly painless to pull out and it doesn't look like it collects anywhere that it can build up and cause a jam in the brushroll. Another surprising thing is that the vac does a pretty good job getting stuff at the edges but at the same time it doesn't suck up random stuff like the cord or clothes lying around, it's crazy.<br /><br />We lowered our review from 4 stars down to 3 due to the filter.",

Not sure if Covid supply chain issues or discontinued already or what\u2026?<br /><br />Only managed to use it 2-3 times after purchase because a good 90% of the time it would not turn on or off when I wanted it to.<br />This was not only annoying but also a potential safety hazard.<br /><br />Changed out the handle battery & tried the troubleshooting steps w/no luck. Took it in for warranty repair & the Oreck store guy said they\u2019d had a whole bunch come through for the same reason.<br /><br />He also said that he had no idea what the fix would be until the parts arrived at the store w/that person\u2019s name on them! Most times they sent a replacement circuit board. Sometimes a new handle assembly. Sometimes they replaced the entire vacuum - but not necessarily w/the same model(!!??).<br /><br />Clearly this is no longer a high-quality  American-made product line - just another Made in China POS w/no quality control, like half the knock-off junk on Amazon these days. Why pay for the Oreck name when it\u2019s really just a crappy overpriced Dirt Devil?<br /><br />\u2026 But I digress.<br /><br />Repairs took nearly a month, during which time we couldn\u2019t vacuum at all.<br /><br />Afterwards it seems to work fine - turns on & off as expected, which is basically the bare minimum it ought to do. Suction seems \u2026 ok? Works well enough but nothing special. The roller assembly is really no different from our old Dirt Devil so i honestly don\u2019t know what we paid for.<br /><br />Have only used it maybe twice since getting it back. Seems ok so far. Don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll hold up over time.<br /><br />Construction seems sturdy enough for a lightweight plastic vacuum, IF the electronics hold up. It\u2019s easy to use & move around, which is nice.<br /><br />Kinda sucks (heh) that we\u2019ll need a separate machine or manual process for dusting, but with our Lifeproof carpet our vacuum options are extremely limited.",

		"text": "*** This is a follow up. My hoover floormates engine died in September, so it only made a several months before it started screaching and smoking. i only used it once a week. I called Hoover and they agreed to cover it under the warranty and they gave me a local service shop and reference number. I called the shop and they will not service Hoovers under the warranty as hoover does not pay them promptly. Unfortunatley I heard this from the 2nd place I called as well. Finally on the third try I was able to find someone who would do it. So reliability is suspect unless I got a lemon and if you do get one that dies under warrantly it may be hard to get it serviced. ***<br /><br />I love this machine. It has 3 modes: vacuum (no water, brushes do not spin), wash (water, suction, and brushes), and dry (lowers slightly for better suction to \"squeegee dry\", no brushes). As mentioned do not buy it thinking it will replace your vacuum. The vacuum part is more like a final cleanup of dirt after sweeping or vacuuming with a normal vac, or cleaning if floor just has light dirt or sand on it. It will not suck up large objects like cheerios,tiny pieces of candy, etc. It washes floors like a champ though! The water is filthy when you empty it. I love that I am not pushing around dirty water anymore an no more mop bucket. You will need to make a few passes on dried on things like dried ketchup. The brushes are very soft aand do not \"scrub\" per se. This is a \"good thing\" when you are talking about cleaning hardwoods though.<br /><br />My whole bottom floor is an open floor plan of ceramic tile and hardwood, over 1000 sqr feet. The machine leaves no steaks and floors look so spotless when done. The grout looks much less dirty know as well after a few cleanings. It really gets all the dirt out of the \"seams\" in the hardwood. Its great for spills too! Make sure you empty and clean it out after it gets full. also, if the suction seems low..take out and put back in the dirty water container...sometimes it looks like it is all the way in and it is not. I have also found turning on and off the vacuum while the handle is upright avoids the missing suction as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cleans great, no streaks<br />good on tile and sealed hardwood<br />No mop bucket anymore!<br />Not using dirty water, much more sanitary<br />Grout gets cleaner than mop becuase it is not leaving dirty water on it to dry<br />Dries super fast, floor is walkable almost immediately after dry mode<br />Gets out he dirt and sand trapped in grooves and gaps in hardwood floor<br />Good for spills<br /><br />Cons:<br />Have to use non-solvent cleaner (made by Hoover)..or vinegar- No Pine-sol or it will eventually leak!<br />Cord is just a few feet short for my large house, so I have to uplug and relcate near the end<br />No \"clip\" to hold cord to handle, so I find myself stepping on cord and unplugging sometimes<br />Brushes are a little too weak and needs a few passes on stuck on stuff<br />Brushes do not get deep into grout, especially my bathroom which has deep grout lines<br />you have to rinse the dirty bucket and re-usable filter after each use<br />Noiser than a mop, but quieter than my normal vacuum",

The adjustment device doesn't contact the component it's intended to because the wheels have another stop which they reach first.  So essentially, the wheels have only one position (since gravity and the weight of the machine push the wheels into a position you can't change) - and this position is higher than the highest carpet setting.  This is not the first Windtunnel we've owned with this type of problem - but the 15 year old machine outperformed this one hands-down on carpet until its suction recently started to die (primarily due to holes developing in the tubing)).

How an upright Vacuum with attachments/hose does not stop the brush in the year 2020 is beyond me to surmise, but it makes the vacuum useless and harmful to your floor while using any attachment.  This particular vacuum does not raise high enough on my carpeting - which is *not* a very plush pile at all.  It may work well with very low pile/tile/hardwood or vinyl, but why it has 4 settings for height is beyond me as the brush doesn't raise enough.<br /><br />I returned it o get a different Bissell model that does at least list that the brush can be turned off.  I may have been spoiled by my last one with a lift-off container and the brush stopped when the handle was upright... I've had that for many years, but alas, it overheated this past week - poor maintenance on my part, but even then it lasted 12 years.<br /><br />This vacuum is a bare floor vacuum that is marketed for carpet as well, but I would say the carpet would be like \"office\" carpet tiles in height only.  Even then, the fact that the brush is constant - I would personally be rushing to get any attachment work done as I would be worried what the things was doing to my floor with my back turned.",

Let me tell you though, it has done an amazing job!! They have TWO 90LB GERMAN SHEPHERDS that leave hair EVERYWHERE not to mention the dust that builds up over time in their house. They previously had a crappy shark vacuum that didnt suck up anything. When I bought this and used it at their house, OMG what a difference!!! It sucked up all the hair and I swear every ounce of dust from at least the past 20 years. I had to dump the canister a million times, but that will happen when you have so much to pick up. I will also say you need to be sure to really clean the filters after a heavy duty cleaning project. I bring it home and remove the filters, wash them out really good, and then let them sit outside in the Texas heat to dry really good before using again. If you need a vacuum that sucks up pet hair really well and is super lightweight look no further. I will probably be purchasing a second one to actually leave at my grandparents house because I have found I like using it too much at my own house. It's quick and easy to just grab and use!",

This vacuum has great power and will satisfy 99% of your household vacuuming needs at a significant cost savings over a Dyson. It's just as maneuverable as a Dyson, has great sucking power, and is quite compact.<br /><br />There are a few cons, but nothing that should stop you from buying it: the hose attachment needs to be manually hooked up to the sucking part of the vacuum - you can't just pull it out and start vacuuming your baseboards. You have to insert one end of the hose into a bypass that redirects sucking power from the main vacuum to the hose. It's mildly annoying if you're switching back and forth between the main vacuum and hose frequently, but still not a deal breaker.<br /><br />The other con is this vacuum is not as easy to empty as a Dyson.

		"text": "A couple of months ago, our old vacuum cleaner gave up the ghost. It went loudly with a hideous burning smell and the release of several pieces onto the living room floor one evening after dinner. Rites were said and the remnants were taken down to the closest dumpster. That meant we had to have a new vacuum as soon as possible. With a cat and two teenage boys, not to mention what Sandi and I track in, vacuuming our two bedroom apartment is a daily necessity.<br /><br />So, Sandi broke out our last remaining credit card with any room at all on it and headed to Home Depot. Her main criteria were price followed ease of use. I am still trying to vacuum around here on occasion and she wanted something that I could use if I absolutely had to do it. It also needed to be light enough to heave it up and down the stairs.<br />She came home with the Dirt Devil MO088160 a fiery red bag-less upright that claimed to be \"lightweight\" and easy to use. It was $54.00 plus sales tax so it fit under the credit line cap on our Home Depot credit card. It boasted that it had a \"long cord for cleaning multiple rooms\" and came with two attachments. One being a crevice tool and the other being an upholstery tool.  It claimed that the \"lightweight design makes it easy to use and carry\" and obviously being made nearly entirely out of plastic was supposed to help that. Clearly, it was a basic vacuum cleaner and that was what we needed.<br /><br />After we put it together, which took about thirty minutes all together with everyone involved in the project; we fired up our latest vacuum cleaner. It worked and it still works.  At this point of over sixty days of use, we have all used it a lot and have a few thoughts.<br /><br />On the plus side, this vacuum cleaner seriously sucks---in a good way. It can really suck up stuff and the small light helps guide you to pick up the obvious stuff you knew was there as well as the junk you didn't see when you first walked through the room. Because it sucks so hard doing its job, if you have some rugs with fringe on them like we do, you have to be careful as it will suck the fringe right off of them. Of course, in so doing it will yank the rug into the beater bar brush and choke on it. This is much like a teenage boy trying to cram a whole hamburger into his mouth on a dare from his baby brother but much less messy.  It does take a few minutes to work everything free and figure out how much damage the run has sustained. It also easily yanks in the cord off the blinds which is always helpful--especially if other family members are home to shriek at you about it while the blinds fly up in the window to slam into the top of the window frame before pulling free and crashing on the floor. It certainly has sucking power.<br /><br />That sucking power does not stop one from going onto the linoleum when one leaves the shag carpeting. Our bathrooms as well as the kitchen have linoleum and it was always a pain to lower the vacuum cleaner to adjust for the different floor surface. This one does not require that manual adjustment which makes it little easier -especially on me if I have my cane in one hand so I can stand and am trying to work the vacuum cleaner in the other. If something happens, like a month ago when a plant pot committed suicide from the kitchen window sill and spayed dirt all across the kitchen floor, I could not wait seven hours for somebody else to get home and clean it up. I had to somehow do it myself and not having to adjust the vacuum cleaner helped.<br /><br />But, there are some negatives. The first one is the noise this thing makes when it is on. The noise level is horrendous.  It roars very loudly. I don't know how to describe it other than imagine a gasoline fired lawn mower. Now, it is not as loud as that, but it seems fairly close.<br /><br />What bothers all of us more than the noise is the fact that it vents out the front. After the detritus is dropped into the bag-less cylinder (easy to remove by the way but very messy) the air shoots out the front of the machine for a radius of about a foot and a half to two feet. This means if you were watching the person vacuuming and they are coming towards you, something may fly into your eyes as has happened here. The force of air coming out of the thing just blasts you and you never know if something is going to hit you, land in your open drink, etc. the best advice is to clear the room of any other folks.<br /><br />Clearing the room also helps to prevent somebody from sitting on their rear and pointing their finger wildly at different points on the floor while he or she assumes you never saw what needed to be vacumned up. Clearing the room of gawkers is helpful in nearly any home or yard situation, but I digress.<br /><br />In between the pluses and the minuses are a couple of things that are negatives for us because of our own situation. They may or may not apply to your situation, but I mention them as they could be important.<br /><br />First, the cord is supposed to be long and I guess at 27 feet it technically is long. However, for us with the way the plugs are laid out in the rooms and everything, 27 feet does not begin to get the job done. We have to use an extension cord to get the length to vacuum this apartment that according to the office is 1050 square feet. Otherwise, it seems all one does is unplug the vacuum cleaner and move to the next plug every couple of minutes and the job takes a lot longer.<br /><br />Second, the box says it weighs less than twelve pounds and that claim is marked by an asterisk.  While there is absolutely nothing in the 24 page instruction booklet (12 pages in English and 12 pages in Spanish) that explains the asterisk or anything on the box, my theory had been that the asterisk referred to the vacuum cleaner in an empty state. However, since the empty vacuum cleaner consistently weighed 18 pounds according to the home scale (which is within one pound of correct according to the scales at my wife's cardiologist) on several occasions, I am not sure how they arrive at the twelve pound claim. I do know for me (who is supposed to lift nothing more than five pounds) this thing seems extremely heavy. My oldest, who last week carried four cases of water all together at one time up the stairs for a neighbor, says the vacuum cleaner is not heavy, just cumbersome. He also loves the New York Yankees so his judgment is suspect at best.<br /><br />In the end, overall, we do like the Dirt Devil MO088160 Vacuum Cleaner. Despite its drawbacks of horrendous noise and venting out the front, it does the job well. A vacuum cleaner should suck stuff up on the first pass and it does. It does that job really well which allows one to tolerate the other issues.<br /><br />Kevin R. Tipple \u00a9 2011",

		"text": "I love Dyson vacuums, at least in terms of their ability to get floors really clean.  I had an older DC14 model for about 10 years and loved it.  But finally it lost is ability to suck (actually, the hose suction still works great!).  So I decided to go with another Dyson.  Well, I will say this DC65 is excellent at getting the floor clean!  Just amazing!  HOWEVER, I am not at all happy with the new design in terms of cleaning the hair from the brush bar.  I have long hair and I lose a lot of hair pretty regularly.  So hair always ends up wrapped around the brush bar.  I was used to cutting away all the hair from the brush bar on my old DC14, probably about every time I cleaned the filters (every 6 months).  It was pretty easy to do, just required cutting away layers of hair with scissors and pulling the hair mats out of the bristles.  Not too complicated.  This is NOT the case on the DC65.  First of all, just to access the brush bar there are 4 tiny screws in hard acrylic plastic that must be removed, which is a pain, but also something that seems like over time will cause the threads in the plastic to wear down.  Then there are two pieces to the bar which come apart and must be removed.  BUT the worst part is that there is this center part the two bar pieces connect to which is responsible for turning the bar.  It is sealed (you must have a special star screw driver to get inside of this part and the company doesn't intend for you to do so), so you would think it would be protected from hair getting sucked in.  Not the case!  I had this vacuum for a very short time, had vacuumed my house probably about 3 times and suddenly the brush bar seized up, and a terrible burning rubber smell filled the room.  Hair had been pulled inside the &#34;sealed&#34; center part and caused friction which melted the plastic and shredded a rubber ring.  There wasn't even a ton of hair on the brush bar! We called the Dyson twice and got the run around for over an hour.  They would not replace it because it was our fault for &#34;not maintaining the vacuum properly.&#34; When this happened we also searched the internet to see if there was anything other had done to fix it.  We did come across other people complaining about this exact same thing, and they were unable to fix it.  Finally I sent an email expressing my disappointment in the way this matter was being handled and my new three hundred seventy dollar vacuum being ruined after just a few uses.  They did eventually replace the part for free (otherwise over a hundred dollars more!), but this is just terrible.  There was not very much hair on it at all and it ruined the brush bar! Now I am stuck disassembling my vacuum every couple times I use it to remove hair so it won't be ruined. This should not be the case!  This is a design flaw in my opinion. I never had these problems with the older DC14.  And there would be a lot of hair on that brush bar, but no damage to the vacuum!  I even choose the &#34;pet hair&#34; model of this DC65 (although we do not have pets inside) and it cannot handle hair!  Also, this vacuum has two filters instead of just one (maybe that's better?) which must be washed every 3 months instead of every 6 months.  And one of them is a pain to access.  And I don't like the way the vacuum goes from upright to the angled position when vacuuming.  It feels like you are breaking something to get it out of the upright position. But, I am giving it the 3 stars as defined by Amazon for an &#34;It's Okay&#34; rating.  It can really clean the floor and gets right up to the baseboards-- but if you have someone in the house with long hair that &#34;sheds&#34; be careful!",

I can at least push it through the carpet with it on the highest setting.  It picks up alot of dirt, as seen in the canister.  But it's a full-body experience pushing it through my thick/plush carpet.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the vacuum features, I really dislike having three sections to clean out (two are simple, but still messy).  I'm about to clean the filter for the first time...hate doing that in any bagless! This appears to be especially messy..we shall see.<br /><br />I did learn, while cleaning my stairs with the &#34;Turbo Brush&#34; attachment, that it's USELESS!  Sure, when you hook it up to the hose, it spins and looks great.  Put it on the carpet and it stops because the airflow has stopped.  So therefore no suction either. The other tool barely has much suction to it either, but I at least could somewhat clean my stairs.<br />The hose only stretched to half-way on the stairs. Had to move the vacuum to the other end to get the rest of the stairs.<br /><br />All in all, it gets the job done, barely. But I wouldn't buy another one like it.  I am looking at another Bissel for my upstairs carpets- because it would have 2&#34; higher on the height (7&#34; vs 5&#34; on this Rewind model), which might make it easier to vacuum my newer carpets.",

		"text": "I bought this vacuum because I have a Bissell already that was, overall, a good vacuum. Its plastic handle broke and I cannot find a replacement part for it (too old I guess). My old vacuum has the beater bar so I keep the old vacuum that now has a short handle specifically for area rugs.<br /><br />As my previous Bissell, the power and suction is good. It is specifically for hardwood floors so no beater bar and I like that. The lobster claw shape, surprisingly, is helpful in getting into some areas like corners and especially around a stove. The assembly could not be easier. It comes in 3 parts and they click together. That's it! The vacuum is especially light, which I really appreciate. The length of the cord was OK. For its solid-surface function it performs well so far. I just vacuumed the entire house with it. The cleaning of this looks to be very similar to my last Bissell, so that looks to be easy. Empty the cup, twist out the piece above the cup, and wash and put back the foam filter. I like the Bissell brand, and hoover, because the motor is powerful and lasts. The price I paid is reasonable.<br /><br />However, this vacuum will not go totally horizontal to get under a bed. The description implied that, but it isn't possible. It lays down quite a ways but won't clean horizontal - the claw will start to raise up. Because of that I would really like an attachment to get under a bed! There are no attachments with this vacuum. I tried vacuuming an area rug, and it did get some debris but really you need a vacuum with a beater brush for a rug, so this is not adequate for that purpose.<br /><br />So overall, I like the vacuum for daily use to keep down the cat hair because I have no wall to wall carpeting. But because I cannot clean under a bed with it, and there is no attachment for that, I rated it with 3 stars overall. I would not buy it again if I had it to do over, simply for that reason. But I did not return it either. All other aspects of the vacuum are positive. So my message to Bissell is that they make good vacuums, and this one would be a GREAT vacuum if they could resolve the under-bed issue. I would also add that even the high end models and brands seldom last for more than 5 years - tops. So because of that I do not buy high end vacuums any longer. I learned my lesson about that on an expensive Dyson that died after just a few months.",

One thing is, I can agree with others on, is the vaccum does seem a bit cheaper, like the plastic and build of it.

		"text": "For the past 10 years my go-to vacuum has been a Dyson DC28 Animal.  It\u2019s been the best vacuum I\u2019ve ever owned.  Technically it\u2019s not as powerful as a previous Hoover Wind Tunnel, but unlike all the Hoover and Bissels I\u2019ve owed, it\u2019s lasted longer than the warranty.  This Samsung costs less than pretty much any Dyson you can buy, so the question is how does it compare?<br /><br />I did some objective testing on hardwood and carpet by spreading out some rice and some sandbox sand.  I weighed out two equal amounts of both, spread them around, vacuumed, and then emptied and weighed the results.  The difference between them was minor and in repeat tests the winner varied.  That told me that \u201chow\u201d I vacuumed was probably a bigger variable than raw suction.<br /><br />For usability I found that the old Dyson was heavier and harder to maneuver.  This was an advantage in one case: when you are using the tools on the Samsung and stretch out the hose it\u2019s easy to knock it over.  The Dyson can be pulled over but it\u2019s much harder.  The lift-off feature was nice, though with the Dyson\u2019s long hose I can achieve the same effect.<br /><br />The Dyson feels and looks sturdier.  The Samsung is lighter, but the plastic seems more fragile.  I also found the Dyson much easier to empty, though both are a pain to clean out if it gets too full of dirt and dust.  I also managed to jam up the Samsung roller with hair once.  It was easy to clear, but it\u2019s something I have to do to the Dyson once a year.  Having it happen after a week of use with the Samsung was not inspiring.<br /><br />In the end the Samsung is a much better value.  For easily \u00bd the price you get pretty much all the performance (granted the test was against a 10 year old Dyson and from what I\u2019ve read the newer Dysons are more powerful than mine).  Time will tell, but I don\u2019t expect to get the same reliability.  Ultimately I think that\u2019s what you are buying with Dyson.  If money is tight this Samsung is the smart buy.  If your budget can handle it I\u2019d certainly consider the Dyson and whether the brand reliability is worth the increased price.",

The longer cord, brush roll shut-off, and the long hose and extension wand.  It has a very high reach in order to get dust off ceiling corners, light fixtures, etc.  However, I was very disappointed when it arrived!  It was not packed very securely. There was only a cardboard bracing around the main part and the other parts were only partially wrapped in plastic. I recently purchased a different Hoover model from Target which I returned due to a model defect, and when it arrived it looked very new and modern and was packed with heavy styrofoam all around it and all wrapped in plastic.  I was so pleased!  Then, I discovered that the cord was getting extremely heated, so I looked it up on the Hoover site and found multiple reviews about the machine overheating.  So, I returned it and ordered this one from Amazon.com. It was the model I originally wanted, but I was leery about ordering a vacuum online.  I worried about problems and having to return online.  I didn't listen to that still small voice and lo and behold I was very disappointed... I am concerned that it might have received abuse in the shipping and the color is not as pictured in the photos...  it is a bright turquoise and looks like something out of the 50s!  Ugh!  Turquoise is the one color I do not like at all...  The color in the photo appears to be a nice blue.  So, I don't know if I received an old refurbished one by mistake or if the information was misrepresented.  Amazon.com did give me a rebate to compensate, but I am still disgusted.  It seems rather cheaply made, especially in comparison to the one I purchased from Target.  However, the Target one (can't remember the model #) didn't have the high reach and longer hose and cord. Also, on the bright side, as I said, it has some good features and great suction.  It just depends on what your priorities are, so I will keep this for the features I like and hope it holds up.  If there is a change I will do an update later.  UPDATE:  I lowered the amount of stars I originally gave to this vacuum because I found that it does not work well at all on bare floors!  My laundry room has some type of linoleum on the floor and when I used the bare floor setting, the suction was so extreme that it not only did not move, but it ripped the top layer of the linoleum right off in spots!  I would like to sue Hoover as I will be responsible for the damage to the floor!  What is wrong with Hoover now?  They used to be tops in vacuums.  Now they have so many different models all with major flaws... why not make a few and perfect them!  Check out their site at hoover.com and you will see the low ratings their vacuums have.",

I have tile floors, 3 area rugs, about 2100 sq feet, one cat and a 1x a week housekeeper who is the primary user of the vacuum, to give you an idea on workload.

Now, Oct 2019, the wheel on the replacement frame snapped off.  Nothing exciting in the use (e.g. only 12 months of use on this frame).  Unfortunately the lower half of the frame is the only piece you can't buy a standalone replacement of.  However we'll see if B&D considers this an under-warranty replacement.

It is effective, easy to use, and cleaning it is simple. It changes suction power automatically based on if you're using it on carpet or hardwood, but you can also control the settings manually. I wouldn't use it as my only vacuum for a large house because it is pretty compact, but for smaller living spaces this is the best deal you will find. Vacuuming without having to mess with a long, tangled cord is life-changing.",

Had to dump it after only vacuuming a small section of my carpet due to all the hair!<br /><br />This vacuum is a lifesaver and I 100% recommend it for anyone with pets and/or allergies",
