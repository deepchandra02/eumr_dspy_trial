Look all through hoses and brush roller assembly for any blockages. Today it was not getting good suction; then motor suddenly cut back on output. Barely runs; does not run in upright position. No suction. Bought this as an \"inexpensive\" replacement to Dyson that died after 5 years. You get what you pay for evidently. Wondering if manufacturer warranty in effect, though I failed to send in the warranty card.",

The item arrived in reasonable time, and assembling is fairly straight forward. However, it doesn't look very new out of the box. Some parts are at the wrong spots and some have dust on them. I don't want to believe Amazon, being such a big name, is selling refurbished items, so I am thinking this may have been caused from shipping. Once put together, the blue cover that covers the waste bag couldn't be closed properly, It falls on the floor all the time while vaccuming. I ended up taping it to the main body. The noise of this thing produces is so high it is unbelievable. I couldn't hear my husband talking when he stands 2 feet away. And this vacuum does NOT work on bare floors (tile floor, wood floor, etc.). It just doesn't work. It not only blows the floor dust around, it also spit out what it already vacuumed in.

So, for less than 1/2 the price and better ratings, I got this one.  Since I switched from a Dirt Devil that I never did like and it had a bag, I can't say this picked up more for sure, but according to the size of the bag the DD used and what came out of this canister, I'd say it probably would have filled the bag a good 1/3- 1/2 the way.  No kidding.  We had just borrowed a friend's Kirby to vacuum a few days ago, so it's not like a month's worth of gunk was laying on the floor.  Only did a 20x15 (guess) living room.  I'd say I'm excited and overwhelmed with the performance but I hate vacuuming, so . . .

I had just vacuumed this room 2 days ago with my Tineco (which I hate) and look at all the dirt my Tineco missed! Bye bye Tineco! What a waste of $200 that vacuum cleaner was.<br /><br />So far first impression these are my pros and cons<br /><br />Pros: lots of power, easy to assemble, loving the option to pop the unit off the roller to clean. Fairly quiet considering who much power this thing has.<br /><br />Cons: This thing is HEAVY! It\u2019s a lot heavier than what I\u2019m used to, but I\u2019m assuming the extra weight is needed for the extra power. I wish the nozzle was a little bit longer to clean blinds and windows. Also the tools themselves could use an upgrade. Decent but not great. Doable tho. People complaining there\u2019s broke, i could see how. This thing is made of plastic. Not a unit you want to man handle or be rough with. It is made of plastic after all.",

It took a while to figure out if the amount of water coming out was appropriate. I learned that you have to sweep very slowly to make sure the brushes are actually cleaning the floor when moving forward and that the water is being suctioned properly while moving towards you.<br /><br />I gave this 3 stars because it is so slow and the water marks from the brushes didn't seem to be cleaning the floor evenly.

Warranty time would then drop from 7 years to 6 months. Amazon was great and gave me the option of a $30 credit to cover the shipping, or return the vacuum.
