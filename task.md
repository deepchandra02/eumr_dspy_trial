I have several large files, converted to text, in a folder. I also have a csv with label, category, description.
The task is to use the methodologies demonstrated in this paper and their code for my use-case - upload a text and get back the label/labels for the document. i have access to text-embeddings-003 and gpt-4.1 from openAI.
